# Description

With **Nemo's Night Progression**, the world keeps progressing while you sleep.    
Sleeping no longer just skips the night - instead, it simulates the time that would have passed:

- **Furnaces** continue smelting as if the night had passed in real-time
- **Crops & Trees** grow by the amount of time skipped

For more details check out the [wiki](https://wiki.devnemo.com/projects/minecraft-mods/nemos-night-progression/general).
