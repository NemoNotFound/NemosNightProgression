# Nemo's Night Progression

## Description

With **Nemo's Night Progression**, the world keeps progressing while you sleep.    
Sleeping no longer just skips the night - instead, it simulates the time that would have passed:

- **Furnaces** continue smelting as if the night had passed in real-time
- **Crops & Trees** grow by the amount of time skipped
