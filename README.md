# Description

**Nemo's Night Progression** enhances your sleeping experience in Minecraft.    
When you sleep, the world progresses naturally - just like time skipped forward:

- **Sleeping** simulates the full passage of time until morning
- **Furnaces** smelt items as if the time had passed normally
- **Crops** grow by the amount of time skipped (WIP)

For full details check out the [wiki](https://github.com/NemoNotFound/NemosNightProgression/wiki).
